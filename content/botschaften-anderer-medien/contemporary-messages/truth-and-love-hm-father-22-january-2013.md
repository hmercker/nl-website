### Truth and Love

Father - received by Helge Mercker on January 22, 2013, Elim, Namibia.

It is your Father, I wish to write.  

The truth requires love. To love one has to be in truth. A Love, so truthful as Mine, is what I have to offer, to give. In the offering of love is living the truth. Know the Truth, know the Love. Teach the Truth, teach (of) Love, live the truth, live the love.

Oh children of mine, truth is simple, love is simple. You have it in you, be willing to live it.  

It is your Father, with loving Truth and truthful Love, loving you  
Father.
