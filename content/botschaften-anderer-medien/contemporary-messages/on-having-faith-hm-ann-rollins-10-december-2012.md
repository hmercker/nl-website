### On having faith

Ann Rollins - received by Helge Mercker on December 10th, 2012, Elim, Namibia.

My dear, dear sister, oh beloved, you are loved indeed, let your tears flow, the tears of love, as you feel us so close and near you.  

The struggles upon the earth plane seem at times to be insurmountable but trust the workings in the higher realms. Many things are happening in the highest of Heavens that will impact the earth plane in the time God, Our Father, sees fit for the mighty changes to happen, the wind of love sweeping across the earth and a new awakening begins in the hearts of men.  

You'll be a witness to the changes and an anker for many, seeding the seeds of love in the new fertile soil. The salvation of mankind will happen in unexpected ways, thus keep your heart and soul open- keep you light shining in the darkness that exist now. Never hesitate or doubt the power of your light and love, step forth with courage, faith and love, to be in truth and have a knowing of the true reality of man. You have touched upon the illusion of your world, but that illusion will crumble and struggle to survive and the reality of love and God's availability of His Love to all, will conquer the world in a sweeping flow of a mighty river (of love). Be aware of your thoughts and actions, your desires and intentions as they will build your future on this plane. Keep on praying for guidance as that will be your task to take upon yourself and will lead many home.

Have faith in you, have faith in God, have faith in us, have faith in the process of unfolding. You have chosen by your soul desires to take up the work that is required (to do) for the awakening of many souls to our Father's Love. You are needed for this work, donâ€™t hold back but ask God for help, guidance and comfort and strength.

We surround you with our love and are always near. Call upon us. I am glad to write again, it is Ann Rollins, your sister in Christ. Goodbye my dear.
