### The Net of Love

Father - received by Helge Mercker on January 9th, 2013, Elim, Namibia.

I am your Father.

My child I wish to talk. You are encouraged to reach out and build your net, yes the net of love, and cast out the net to bring home the many it will hold. Be fishermen of souls, and harvest Love-  to reap the fruits of the tree that is My Kingdom. Reach out and hold each other to form this web of Love, the net of My Love. Reach those that want to be enveloped by It (the Love). You are my child, there are many children, play together in the reflection of my smile as you all know, how I love you !  

I am Your Father - sleep my child, sweet sleep.
