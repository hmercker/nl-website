### Personal Guidance

Judas - received by Helge Mercker on January 4th, 2013, Elim, Namibia.

It is Judas, I am glad you write. Recognize that you are the executing force (ausfuehrende Kraft) to do your will and desire. Strive for it to be in accord with our Father’s Will. But you need to express and have an awareness of your deep soul desires and passions. It is not about doing the thing you feel you have to do, rather feel that which you wish to do and want to do. Give yourself time and space to find clarity as you impose some pressure upon yourself of having to do the right and proper thing. Feel it from within what it is you are made of, you are intended to do or what you like doing. Find your purpose. We help you. Pray to God to show you what your purpose is, to be the bright star, to be the bright light of love, the teacher of caring and loving, the mother of babies and children, the speaker of truths, the inspirer and encourager, the steamer blazing the way. Be steadfast in your journeying along the straight and narrow path of Divine Love and the way of soul discovery and – development (progression).

It is indeed with joy I witness your commitment and be encouraged to take yet another step towards fulfilling your dream of becoming ever closer and at-one with our Father. The realities of a dreamer are the dreams that become real. In the realization of a dream lies the witness and evidence of faith. Behold the faith of the reality dreamed of.

Yes, you are doing well, keep on writing, you become energized. It is with happiness I write now as I feel you closer and I am very pleased by your desire to wanting to be closer to us as we love you deeply and so much want to help you to fulfil the path God intends you to walk to being a true witness of His Love. Feel Her/His endearing  Love for you. You are worthy of Her/His Love and Attention, you are worth of the brightest Heavens of Love. You are worthy of Love my sweet dear sister, beloved child of God, we are all worthy of Love. It is free, you don’t have to suffer for It, you don’t have to buy it or be someone else. Pray more of being open to receive this Love, how you love to be loved as the Love makes you love more.  

My dear, I am glad I was able to write a little longer today and will come again soon. Indeed it is your angel friend, the Judas.
