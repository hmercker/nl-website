We see your struggles of living a life of truthfulness and love, and we help you to gain greater realisations of things/situations to avoid to become less exposed to things that cause conflicts within you. You are vulnerable, strengthen yourself through faithful prayers directed to our Heavenly Father, for herein lies the answers in how to conduct yourself to be a true channel of His Love. Your abidance of all His Laws is the goal, thus learn and have a greater awareness of His Laws and their interplay. This will help you to navigate through your earthly existence with greater ease and you are able to let go of conflicts and struggles within you. Above all, pray for our Father’s Love, as this Love increase its presence and inhabits your soul to a larger degree, your awareness of truth of our ever present Father makes it easier for you to comprehend the meaning of your life in the world (earth life and thereafter). You are on your way, we are always here to help you and call upon us in any hour for our’s is a task of love for our beloved brothers and sisters. Feel comfort in the protection you receive through our presence. Feel with your heart and soul, let your eyes and mind be the binocular for the observation of your surroundings, let your soul speak and not your head. Embrace all of your past experiences as they brought you where you are today. Be grateful for all the encounters you had, as everyone is a part of your individualisation.  

You are engulfed with love. We are the helpers on this side helping the helpers on your side. Study “Help/Service”, as we spoke about it before (Higher Law of Help/Service). I wish you a blessed afternoon and continue to embrace a desire searching for more Truths and desire to pray more often and more sincerely.  

It is your brother Jesus, in the highest location of the Celestial heavens and close to our Father. I am Jesus of the Bible. Goodbye.
