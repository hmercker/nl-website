### Courage

Emi and Martin Luther - received by Helge Mercker on July 13, 2017, Swakopmund, Namibia.

It is the Love of the Father who brings you the joy, who brings you the insights, who will guide you. It is the Love of our Heavenly Father, the Divine Love within your soul that radiates to all and everything around you. Continue in your prayers for this Love-it is the living essence. This Love shines bright within you my dear, dear daughter and Soul Sister. You are deeply loved and continue in your efforts. Continue on, my dear, continue on. Yes, it is your grandmother, it is Emi, who is always around you and who supports you and guides you and who assists you for the many things in this plane for you to open up. I am with your parents and I am very close. So, whenever you need help or company, just think of me and I am there. Yes, Luther is very eager to teach you more, to become more aware of many more things that you are capable of understanding and experiencing and knowing. Indeed, he is very eager as there is so much that awaits. He so much wishes to share with you and have a close rapport with you and he will be delighted when finally the final version of your book will be published.

Yes, your brothers and sisters in this undertaking and project are also praying very often. You are all bonded. Continue in your prayers as they are most beneficial. Not only for you, but all who pray with you and with whom you pray and it brings us very close. So continue in your efforts of praying and the routine that you have established will prove to be beneficial. You will see, you will see!

Surmounting the daily tasks don't need to be rushed, they don't need to overburden you, but just be in the peace and in the flow of God's Love. They will be accomplished with a great ease. And your support and love that you give to others, is in the way and in the flow of this Love. Do not doubt this. Do not take this as a burden, but as a gesture of being an instrument of God. Accomplishing all these little tasks each receiving a blessing.  

My dear child, my sweet child, I love you dearly. Know that you are in good company as many of us are with you and guide you and share your day and your night with you. Enjoy God’s Love. Enjoy the peace. There is so much to be enjoyed. Enjoy life. I love you, my child, I love you, God bless you. It is your beloved grandmother, Emi.

I am here too, it is Luther.

Yes, your grandmother is very close to you and I am glad that she is always with you and whenever you desire to have company, just think of her, of me, of James, of all the ones who accompany you for we are very close. Yes, there are many lessons to be learnt my dear and there are many things I want to teach you for the development especially for the direct voice and also other manifestations in this world. As you know -much awaits, much awaits - and many changes will happen and they happen fast. So, I want you to be grounded and properly prepared for those times.  

God’s Love is to own the most powerful gift as this will facilitate many things. Not only the healing of your soul, but also the healing of your body and of everything that is around you. The healing of your thinking, the way of thinking. The immersion within God's presence, within God's Love as a practice, is a reality. And I wish for you to enter that state as often as possible throughout the day and night of course. But be aware of it and your schedule of Prayer-hours is very good and I would advise -even during the day- in your thinking and in your thoughts to be at-one with this Love and recognise the Love within you. You often pray about God letting His Love shine within you and to make it useful – and indeed, make yourself available to be useful. There are many, many moments. And even if you can't be there in the physical, a prayer will suffice.

Yes, I am Martin Luther. I am your guide and teacher and your friend - and you know this.

My love for God always has been of a depth that made me a committed person, a committed man to the Truth as I perceived and understood it- a commitment to God- when I lived on earth. That is what gave me the courage. That is the ingredient that gave me the courage. I wish for you to -as you often pray for courage- I wish for you to realize it is your bond, your closeness to God. It is your commitment to God, your commitment to His Love. This deep relationship of trust. In that, and the faith that comes from that, the faith- that is an absolute building block of this relationship of trusting.

So strengthen your faith when you pray for courage. Trust God. And you will realize that the courage lies in that. It is not something that you take on. It comes through faith and trusting God, in your love for God. Everything else will fall away, you will see.  

I am by your side and I walk with you. So are many more. So thus, have courage. Go forth. Stand in your truth. Pray to be in God’s Light. Pray for His Love and all things will be taken care of. All things will unfold as God wishes. Trust yourself. Love yourself! Have faith in your capabilities. Trust who you are.  What unfolds for you, trust this. Trust the deep feelings from inside, trust your soul. Trust what is within you. Love yourself and love the gifts - some of them you are aware of, others there is a tentative knowing. Embrace it. You are close, embrace it, you will recognize them as time goes on. Don't hold back. Continue your experimenting, your researching, your dedication. Your dedication to this project. Your dedication to your friends and friendships - that is also very important ingredient. Your dedication to live your soul awakening, to live the awarenesses that come up. Live them ! - with gratitude to our Heavenly Father. Do not shut them away, put them in a box and leave them for another day. Live them now. Live them.

My dear, I am with you. I guide you. I love you and I want to share so much with you. Much awaits for all of us - for you and me and all who are engaged in the project of Direct Voice. But not only that – engaged in a much bigger task, way bigger – it is difficult to see at this point-  and that is alright. Just continue. Small steps. Good. Now, have a good day and enjoy this day and be in the flow of God’s Love. Reach out, smile, embrace. I love you. I am Martin Luther.
