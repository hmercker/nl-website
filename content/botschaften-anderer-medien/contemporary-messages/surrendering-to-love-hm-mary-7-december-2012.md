### Surrendering to Love

Mary - received by Helge Mercker on December 7th, 2012, Elim, Namibia.

My beloved sister, oh dear child H, we are with you, we are with you always, you are never alone, never feel alone as so many are beside you, work beside you. You are loved my dear, so deeply, know that. This is a fact and a truth. Indulge in this love as it will help you heal, heal old wounds and lets you surrender to love. Surrendering to love will open the flood gates and opens you up for receiving more and more of our Father's Love upon your desiring so. It is the surrender that is required my dear, completely and fully.  

Be loved and enjoy being love, find the happiness in the knowledge of being loved. Express your happiness of knowing you are so deeply loved, celebrate it and you will also see how contagious the celebration is and you will be asked about your joy and happiness and you are thus in a position of sharing Truths of our Father's Love.  

Celebrate, be joyous, be happy, we celebrate with you. Forget and let go of the rusty old patterns of the brain and mind, and dive into your soul experiences. As you grow in this Love, more and more your soul does the experiencing. Feel from the soul about another, love them from that place and all judgements and grudges will fall away. Pray for this and ask our Father to help you feel and love from the soul. [...]

My dear, cheer up, we are helping you in your endeavours of building the orphanage and it is a good and loving undertaking. You/we will help many and minister to many. Keep your prayer practice, to keep the balance and not succumb to mundane earthly matters and untruths. Stay balanced, work from the soul and not your mind. Remain in love all the time, focus on God every moment and all will be easy and everything unfolds as God wishes it.

We are constantly with you and help you, feel our promptings; be a clear channel of the Love, an (active) agent of change, an upholder of Truths and a light bearer in the darkness. We love you dearly, you are surrounded by love, we uphold you. Be blessed with our Father's Love, it is Mary, the mother of Jesus, a resident in the Celestial Heavens, your guardian and angel friend.
