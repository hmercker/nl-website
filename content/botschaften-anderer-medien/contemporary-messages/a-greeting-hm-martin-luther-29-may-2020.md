### A Greeting

Martin Luther – received by Helge Mercker on May 29, 2020, Swakopmund, Namibia.

My daughter, I am here, Martin Luther.

Rely on God's Guidance and all will be well. Do not let yourself be tossed and turned in your thoughts but be in harmony with God's Love and feel His Peace and Presence. Everything comes from Him that can help you, guide and direct you. His powerful Love, this powerful energy is that, which lets you take the next step. Trust it, dear child. Trust in our Heavenly Father and all will be well.

Your many avenues of thought always lead to one point, the desire to be with God. Is it not so? That feeling of seeking and longing to be in His presence, to feel His Care and Love. And so it is and one sinks into prayer and this holy communion. Be with Him and feel His blessings and He opens the doors for you to take the next step forward. Seek to be filled with His Love and be faithful to Him and the ways will open. 

I bring you a greeting of love and support. Know that everything is guided by His Love. Good night, I am and will stay with you. Martin Luther greets you.
