### Loving God's Creation

Father - received by Helge Mercker on November 27th, 2012, Elim, 2012.

I wish to talk, it is your Father, dear child, why hesitate to reach out to the ones you love, why take orders from your head, when you feel your heart says something else. Love is never wasted, Love is always gifted. My dear sweet child it is your Father, who embraces you always. You give me joy, you make me smile. Love yourself as I love you ! You will be strengthened by my love, as you know that many tasks await you. I wish to hold your hand as you walk on discovering the world of my Love, my Grace and Mercy.  

As you know I am bound by my love for all that I created. I love all that is. The failure to recognize love, and the pride in the human heart are the stumbling blocks for humanity to see the creation that I created. I love all and want all of my children to turn to the true Love, and I gift my Love to those who earnestly, sincerely and deeply want It. Strive to fulfil this purpose of a fulfilled, soulful life as I intended you to live.  

Recognize the creative side in you, the fulfilling and honouring of the gifts I have bestowed upon you when I created you. Long for the unfolding of the talents and gifts my child. I wish so much for my children to awake to the true beautiful beings that I created them to be. Touch your heart like I touch it and feel the softness of your love that I created you with; and leave behind that heart of stone that has become the hearts of humanity.  

Be a part my child of having a heart of flesh and a soft flowing love for all my creatures and creation. It is your Father speaking now, upholding you, with arms of love. I love you, your Father.
