### New-Year Greeting

Jesus - received by Helge Mercker on January 1st , 2013, Elim, Namibia.

I am here, it is Jesus (smiling gently) You are in the circle of friends, we are here, we are all here to tell you how we love you and cherish our friendship (joyous ,festive, celebratory feeling).

We are happy for this new era and new year. We acknowledge all of you who did the work of our Father, we express our love and gratitude to you all my brothers and sisters for your efforts don’t go by unnoticed. Now we are facing greater opportunities than ever before of sharing the Truths and the existence of our Father’s Gift, His Love. Each and everyone is applauded in your efforts and many more and greater tasks await you. Know of the mighty numbers of helpers on this side and you will know of the certainty of success of all our efforts. Hold each other in closeness, support each other and continue to pray together like you have been doing. It is with joy and happiness that we and many more participate.

I greet you with greetings of joyous anticipation as you enter into a new year and we are looking forward and know of our working together. You are upheld  in our love and ever readiness  to help. Call on us.

It is me Jesus, your older brother, close to the fountain head of our Father, ever eager to help for each and everyone to discover the knowledge and wisdom of our Father.
