### Become a Follower of my Teachings

Jesus - received by Helge Mercker on January 8th, 2013, Elim, Namibia.

I am here my dear sister in our Father’s Love. Have no hesitancy to call us as we want to help you on any decisions or any statements you wish to express, call on us.

I am your brother and want to help you to become a true follower of my teachings and a disciple. As in the old days we were fishermen of men as it is today. You don’t need qualifications or titles to share the Love or share the Truths. It is the passion in the heart, the desires of the soul that will determine the willingness to do the work of Love. You have the ability to walk and talk amongst the people who are seeking. I encourage you to pray for a greater desire to share with a passionate heart the Truths. Be my true disciple in the flesh. I’ll be by your side and you will never be alone as we are all very eager to share and spread the Truths.

Let your heart be open, let the Love flow, God will take care of the rest, it is that simple ! My dear sister, stay close to your brothers and sisters in the flesh. They need you and you need them. Support each other. Keep the network(ing) alive and the flame of Love burning by fuelling it with the desires for more Love and doing God’s Will. Share yourselves. You are all unique with talents and gifts, when shared will make a wonderful pool of resources to distribute the teachings of the true Love. The world is hungry and thirsty, do your part in sharing where the refreshing fountain of Love is, the food for nourishing the souls.

All of you are needed so desperately, stand together, Love includes everyone. Be the examples of Love, express it to each other to be able to demonstrate it to those who seek. Loving kindness, mutual encouragements and standing by each other will be the glue that keeps you together. You need to be strong, the foundation build on solid rock of our Father’s Love. Don’t let yourself and the group be swayed by shifting sand of doubt, divisions and differences.
We need you to feel our ever presence, we help you, support you. Never feel alone or abandoned as we are working together. Upholder of Truths, have courage, stay in prayer, long for God in every moment, long for doing His Will. Keep committed to prayers, be consistent. The strength lies in prayers, God has always an open ear.

We love you and feel our love for each and everyone, it is Jesus, your brother and way shower upon the straight and narrow path to our Father. Goodbye.
