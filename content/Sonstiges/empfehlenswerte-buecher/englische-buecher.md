![](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/living-with-the-divine-love-book-cover-small.jpg/) [Living with the Divine Love](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/living-with-the-divine-love.pdf/) | As our world slides into greater disharmony and chaos, as our hearts cry out for healing and peace, for joy and love, for unity and understanding, we ever seek to find that state of grace in our search for the living waters of life, the living waters of love. I invite you, to read what I am sharing here of my experiences in following a path of love, of Divine Love. It is a discovery of soul and acknowledgment of the subtle transformative action that the Divine Love brings. A discovery of the relationship to our Creator, a discovery of Love so deep that I never dared to dream of it. Daily prayers and communion with God are the cornerstone of this life upon our pathway of Love Divine. It is a gentle path which does not need formalism or buildings or temples or preachers. No, it is simple, it is rather a way of life, a way of awakened living, a life of internal and eternal growth in Love, the Divine Love, an opening to God’s Truths and an awareness of God’s Presence, a purification and transformation of soul.
![](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/new-testament-revelations-book-cover-small.jpg/) [New Testament Revelations](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/new-testament-revelations.pdf/) | For those who already are familiar with the messages received by James E. Padgett, Dr. Samuels’s channelings are a deep and profound blessing in that they provide continuity and integration between the teachings of the Bible and the revelations received through Mr. Padgett.
![](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/old-testament-sermons-book-cover-small.jpg/) [Old Testament Sermons](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/old-testament-sermons.pdf/) | For those who already are familiar with the messages received by James E. Padgett, Dr. Samuels’s channelings are a deep and profound blessing in that they provide continuity and integration between the teachings of the Bible and the revelations received through Mr. Padgett. The messages received by Dr. Samuels are fundamentally different from the so-called Padgett-Messages. This is not surprising when you consider that Dr. Samuels already had an extensive basic knowledge at his disposal, while James Padgett had to start from scratch before he was even able to receive the messages from high Celestial spirits. Dr. Samuels, on the other hand, was already aware of these basic revelations before he dedicated himself to the task of becoming active in mediumship.
![](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/the-way-cover-small.jpg) [The Way](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/the-way.pdf) | Ron Shoemaker is sharing his gift of writing and bringing forth through his essays the Good News of God’s Divine Love to all who seek it with a sincere heart and soul longings. May these writings be inspiring and uplifting as we embrace this transforming gift of Divine Love in deep gratitude to our Creator.
![](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/our-world-in-transition-messages-from-jesus-cover.jpg) [Our World in Transition](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/our-world-in-transition-messages-from-jesus-inside.pdf) | This channeled material, accredited to Jesus of Nazareth and Master of the Celestial Heavens, does much to clarify those most important issues of life’s purpose and direction. This is a rich and dense collection of teachings given over a period of time through the Mediumship of Albert J Fike. Jesus gives both a warning and invitation to every soul upon the planet regarding the current state of our world as it continues to escalate towards greater challenges and ecological degradation. What is shared is inspiring and powerful in its commentary about modern life and contains deep spiritual gems embedded in every page.
![](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/finding-our-way-home-single-cover.pdf) [Finding our Way Home](/sonstiges/empfehlenswerte-buecher/finding-our-way-home-inside.pdf/) | This second book in the series of lessons received from Jesus of Nazareth through the mediumship of Albert J. Fike offers many insights and details regarding the journey of the soul. Earth changes and the continued soul awakening of humanity are central themes of this book. Lessons on soul and spirit progression, reincarnation and the abundance of life on other planets in the universe are also well considered topics. As with the first book, Our World in Transition, every page is filled with spiritual wisdom and inspiration which will help stoke the fires of your personal soul awakening.
