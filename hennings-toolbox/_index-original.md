# Botschaften nach Jahr geortnet

This is a second level menu item. This page should contain the links to the various year groupings

I will add a 3 column table here as an example. This would not normally be on this particular page, but rather on the page for the year [1969](/aktuelle-botschaften/botschaften-sortiert-jahr/messages-1969/)


But what would be on this page is a single column table loading each years listing. Now I have those files as ordinary .md files and not as _index.md files. Not sure why, but probably an historic reason.

So lets assume you will decide what you want to do and won't slavishly follow what I am doing now, because I am not sure which will work better. But I have found that when editing the data files it is nice to be able to access all the source and index files in one place.

One of the nuisances is that ALL tables follow the same format rules. So I cannot get this simple table to centre. I have packed it out using $nbsp  - non-breaking spaces - on SoulTruth. On New Birth I did not bother.

 | **Year** |   |
---|---|---
 | [1969](/Aktuelle Botschaften/Botschaften nach Jahr geortnet/Botschaften 1969/) | |
 | 1970 | |
 | 1980 | |
 | [2020](/aktuelle-botschaften/botschaften-sortiert-jahr/messages-2020/) | |

 So on New Birth I did this:

| **Year**
|---
| 1969
| 1970
| 1980
| 2020
